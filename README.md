# Diffusion-Monte-Carlo


These codes have been developed originally as part of my MSc research project looking into Diffusion Monte Carlo.


I am in the process of adding more codes to this repo.


Typical final energy results of the codes are as follows (all energies given in natural units):

H2  -1.1646 Â± 0.0027
