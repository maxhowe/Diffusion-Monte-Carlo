# Diffusion-Monte-Carlo


These codes have been developed originally as part of my MSc research project looking into Diffusion Monte Carlo.


I am in the process of adding more codes to this repo.


Typical final energy results of the codes are as follows (all energies given in natural units):

1D HO:  0.4999 ± 0.0010    (Exact: 0.5) 

H2:     -1.1649 ± 0.0027   (Exact: -1.1645)
